# Theming

Fwoosh aims to be very flexible in regards to theming.

There are two main ways to theme Fwoosh:

1. Providing custom theme tokens
2. Overriding components

## Tokens

Tokens are the building blocks of a theme.
They are used to define colors, fonts, spacing, and other design decisions.

You can customize the token values used by Fwoosh by using the <Link to="Configuration#theme">theme options</Link>

A theme simply sets the values of the tokens used by Fwoosh.

> NOTE: For colors we suggest you use [Radix colors](https://www.radix-ui.com/colors)

```tsx
import { Theme } from "@fwoosh/types";
import { slate, blue, blueDark, slateDark } from "@radix-ui/colors";

export const light: Theme = {
  colors: {
    // Use a blue-ish tinted grey for the greys
    ...(Object.fromEntries(
      Object.values(slate).map((color, index) => [`gray${index}`, color])
    ) as Record<string, string>),
    // Use blue as the primary color
    ...(Object.fromEntries(
      Object.values(blue).map((color, index) => [`primary${index}`, color])
    ) as Record<string, string>),
  },
};

// Configure the dark mode variants of the above
export const dark: Theme = {
  colors: {
    ...(Object.fromEntries(
      Object.values(slateDark).map((color, index) => [`gray${index}`, color])
    ) as Record<string, string>),
    ...(Object.fromEntries(
      Object.values(blueDark).map((color, index) => [`primary${index}`, color])
    ) as Record<string, string>),
  },
};
```

## Component Overrides

Fwoosh offers the ability to take full control of most presentation and layout component in the UI.

You can add component overrides to Fwoosh by using the <Link to="Configuration#componentOverrides">`componentOverrides` options</Link>.

```ts
export const config: FwooshConfig = {
  componentOverrides: "./path/to/componentOverrides.tsx",
};
```

Once you have that configured create the file that contains your overrides.

```tsx
import * as React from "react";

export const Spinner = () => <div>loading</div>;

export const h1 = (props: React.ComponentProps<"h1">) => {
  return <h1 style={{ color: "red", fontSize: 40 }} {...props} />;
};
```

Now whenever the UI wants to render one of these components fwoosh will instead
use you override.

For a full list of what to override view [`@fwoosh/components/src/index.ts`](https://github.com/hipstersmoothie/fwoosh/blob/main/packages/components/src/index.tsx).
