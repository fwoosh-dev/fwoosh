title: CircleCI
---

The following config declares the `release` job and uses it in the `build_and_release` workflow. The `release` job will run at the end of each build and either release:

- a new `latest` version from `baseBranch`
- a `canary` build from a pull request (if your package manager plugin implements them)

```yaml
version: 2

defaults: &defaults
  working_directory: ~/auto
  docker:
    - image: circleci/node:latest-browsers

jobs:
  install: # your install job

  release:
    <<: *defaults
    steps:
      - attach_workspace:
          at: ~/auto
      - run:
          name: Release
          command: npx auto shipit

workflows:
  version: 2
  build_and_release:
    jobs:
      - install

      - release:
          requires:
            - install
```

## Troubleshooting

If you are having problems make sure you have done the following:

- `GH_TOKEN` is set
- Any other secrets for plugins are set (Ex; `NPM_TOKEN` with the NPM plugin)

### Problems pushing tags to github

Go to Settings -> Checkout SSH Keys -> `Create and add YOUR_USERNAME user key`. This will create a key with the ability to push to github.

## Examples

- [`auto`](https://github.com/intuit/auto/blob/main/.circleci/config.yml)
- [`reaction`](https://github.com/artsy/reaction/blob/master/.circleci/config.yml)
