It lets you build components in isolation which helps you to develop, document and test them in faster.

## Installation

```sh
npm i --save-dev fwoosh
# or
yarn add -D fwoosh
```

Then create a `fwoosh.config.mjs` file in the root of your project:

```ts
import { FwooshConfig } from "fwoosh";

export const config: FwooshConfig = {

};
```
