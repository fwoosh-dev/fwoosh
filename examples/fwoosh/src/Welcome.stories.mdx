# Fwoosh

Fwoosh is a component development and documentation tool.
Inspired by [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) Fwoosh help you build components in isolation and document them with ease.

## Installation

To get started first install fwoosh:

```sh
npm i --save-dev fwoosh
# or
yarn add -D fwoosh
```

Then create a `fwoosh.config.mjs` file in the root of your project:

```ts
import { FwooshConfig } from "fwoosh";

export const config: FwooshConfig = {
  title: "My Design System",
};
```
