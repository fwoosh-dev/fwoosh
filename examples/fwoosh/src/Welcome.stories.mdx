Fwoosh is a front-end notebook inspired by [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/).

A front-end notebook is composed of `stories` and documentation.

> `story` - A contained interactive example

Fwoosh has multiple ways to view and interact with your stories:

- `/workbench` - Focus on individual stories. Good for development
- `/docs` - Stories are combined into documentation. You can also author content-only pages as MDX
- `/canvas` - Top level view of all documentation and stories. See the full picture in a spatial interface

## Installation

To get started first install fwoosh:

```sh
npm i --save-dev fwoosh
# or
yarn add -D fwoosh
```

Then create a `fwoosh.config.mjs` file in the root of your project:

```ts
import { FwooshConfig } from "fwoosh";

export const config: FwooshConfig = {
  title: "My Design System",
};
```
