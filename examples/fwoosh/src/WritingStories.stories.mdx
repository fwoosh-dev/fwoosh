# Writing Stories

> A story captures the rendered state of a UI component.
> It's a function that returns a component's state given a set of arguments.

## Creating a Story File

Create a file with the `.stories.tsx` extension that will be matched by your <Link to="Configuration#stories">stories glob</Link>.

### Define the `meta`

In this file add a `meta` export.
This is the metadata for your story.

```tsx
import type { StoryMeta } from "fwoosh";

export const meta: StoryMeta = {
  title: "Components/Button",
};
```

In the above example the title is `Components/Button`.
This will be used to group stories together in the sidebar.
In this example the stories for the `Button` component will be grouped under the `Components` section.

> NOTE: Titles can go as deep as you want!

### Write a Story

To write a story you need to export a function that returns a component.

```tsx
export const Basic = () => {
  return <Button>Click Me</Button>;
};
```

## Advanced Story Configuration

### `component`

The `component` property is used to link a group of stories to a component.
This is used to generate the documenatin for the properties of the component in the story.

```tsx
export const meta: StoryMeta = {
  title: "Components/Button",
  component: Button,
};
```

#### `component` on Story

You can override the `component` property on a story.
This is useful if you want to generate documentation for components that only appear on a specific story.

```tsx
Basic.component = OtherButton;
```
