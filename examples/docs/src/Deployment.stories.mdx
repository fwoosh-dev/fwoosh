# Deployment

To deploy your application, you need to build it first. This is done by running the following command:

```bash
npx fwoosh build
```

This will build your application into the `outDir` directory, which is `out` by default.
You can then deploy the contents of this directory to your web server.

To test that your application is working, you can run the following command:

```bash
npx fwoosh serve
```

This will start a local server on port 3000. You can then visit `http://localhost:3000` to see your application.

## GitHub Pages

If you want to deploy your application to GitHub Pages, simply push the contents of the `outDir` directory to the `gh-pages` branch of your repository.

## Vercel

If you want to deploy your website on Vercel you must first create a `vercel.json` at the root of your project with the following content:

```json
{
  "buildCommand": "fwoosh build",
  "outputDirectory": "out",
  "headers": [
    {
      "source": "/assets/:path*",
      "headers": [
        {
          "key": "Cache-Control",
          "value": "public, max-age=31536000, immutable"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
