# Decorators

A decorator is a wrapper around a story that effects layout, supplies data, or whatever else you want.

## Configuration

### Story Level

You can define add a decorator to a specific story.
The decorator will only be used for this story.

```tsx Example.stories.tsx
import { Story } from "@fwoosh/react";
import { centered } from "@fwoosh/decorator-centered";

export const Example: Story = () => <div>Foo</div>;

Example.decorator = [centered];
```

### File Level

If you add the decorator to the `meta` object, it will be applied to all stories in the file.

```tsx Example.stories.tsx
import { centered } from "@fwoosh/decorator-centered";

export const meta: StoryMeta = {
  title: "Components/Example",
  component: Example,
  decorators: [centered],
};
```

### Global

You can also add a decorator to all stories in your project.
To do this export a `decorators` array from your <Link to="Configuration#setup">setup file</Link>.

```tsx fwoosh-setup.ts
import { centered } from "@fwoosh/decorator-centered";
import { Decorator } from "@fwoosh/react";

export const decorators: Decorator[] = [centered];
```
